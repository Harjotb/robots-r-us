# Robots-R-Us

## Description

You've just been hired at Robots-R-Us. Your first task is to finish an employee directory using React with a backend API written in Rails. [Example data](src/data.json) is provided, and the designer gave you this spec to work off:

![Image of Robots-R-Us](https://i.imgur.com/rIN6Ehp.png)

Before the project was assigned to you, your co-worker started building out the feature with [React-Table 6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table-6). The scaffolding of the API and React-Table are both done, there are just a few small tasks left...

## Objective

* Finish the employee directory using the existing React-Table component; finished product should resemble the spec above
* Build a database-backed API to return (optionally filtered) employee data
* Open a pull request against `main` with whatever you've completed to have your code reviewed

## Guidelines
* Please don't spend more than 1 or 2 hours on this challenge.  It's okay to not finish everything.  Do what you can as well as you can.
* This is a full-stack exercise, but if you can't do everything focus on the area that is your strongest.  If you are familiar with Rails but not React, consider starting there and think of React as a bonus.  If you are familiar with React but not Rails, then consider doing the opposite.
* Commit often, perfect later â€” commit your code as you go, even if it's not perfect (it will help us understand your process and train of thought). That being said, make sure your final product is code you're proud of
* Feel free to use libraries and plugins (lodash, styled-components, etc). We use them all the time
* Don't worry about automated tests. They're not required (but it won't hurt if you want to add some)

## Getting Started

### Fork this repo

Click on the Fork button in the top-right corner of this repo. This creates a new copy of `robots-r-us` under your GitHub user account with a URL like:
```
https://github.com/<YourUserName>/robots-r-us
```
The copy includes all the code, branches, and commits from the original repo.

Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/robots-r-us
```
Once the repo is cloned, you need to do two things:

Create a new branch by issuing the command:
```
git checkout -b <your_name_and_branch_name>
```

Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bloomfire/robots-r-us
```
In this case, "upstream repo" refers to the original repo you created your fork from.

### Up & Running

* Install Node (>= 14.5) & Yarn (>= 1.17)
* Install Ruby (>= 3.0)
* Install Dependencies

Disclaimer: _Please_ do not hesitate to reach out the hiring manager if you have trouble with these steps. We know installation can be tricky; we won't hold it against you if you do.

```
$ cd robots-r-us
$ yarn
$ cd api
$ bundle
```

Get the server running

```
$ cd robots-r-us
$ yarn start
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## To-Do
1. Massage the data (either hardcoded data.json OR the API) into the following form:

```
const formattedColumns = [
  { Header: "ID", accessor: "id" },
  { Header: "First Name", accessor: "first_name" },
  { Header: "Last Name", accessor: "last_name" },
  { Header: "Email Address", accessor: "email" },
  { Header: "Job Title", accessor: "title" },
  { Header: "Profile Picture", accessor: "avatar" },
];

const formattedData = [
  { id: 1, first_name: "Red", last_name: "Pudner", email: "rpudner0@shareasale.com", title: "Pharmacist", avatar: '...' },
  { id: 2, first_name: "Olva", last_name: "Kellegher", email: "okellegher1@prlog.org", title: null, avatar: '...' },
  { id: 3, first_name: "Byrle", last_name: "Dick", email: null, title: null, avatar: '...' },
  { id: 4, first_name: "Cecile", last_name: "Rainton", email: "crainton3@artisteer.com", title: "Recruiter", avatar: '...' },
  { id: 5, first_name: "Gwennie", last_name: "Clancy", email: "gclancy4@ifeng.com", title: "Chief Design Engineer", avatar: '...' },
  { id: 6, first_name: "Meriel", last_name: "Form", email: "mform5@mozilla.org", title: null, avatar: '...' },
...
];
```
You can do this by
* Restructuring the `/api/employees` API endpoint
* Manipulating the [hardcoded data](src/data.json) directly
* Formatting the data in the [Selectors](src/data/selectors.js) if you're familiar with Redux

All are viable options, and we will not think less of either solution!
No matter _how_ you do it, we just need to see the data manipulated into the correct shape :)

2. Make sure the API is fed by a database (e.g. SQLite3)
3. Build in filtering to the API based on query parameter, e.g. `/api/employees?first_name=Red&last_name=Pudner`

#### Bonus points if you...
* Render the robots' avatars (with a default avatar for those who don't have one)
* Sort robots by last name (API and/or React)
